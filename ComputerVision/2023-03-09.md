#### Salt and pepper noise
Can be caused by either:
- Physical damage to sensor
- Signal transmassing error. 
- Disparity maps: we compare the distance to every point of this region.  
	- If we are comparing two different images, we'll get the salt and pepper noise on the disparity map.  

### Gaussian filter
LTE operator whose impulse response is a 2D Gaussian function (with zero mean and constant diagonal covariance matrix). 

- It works because pixels that are further away should not influence the pixel. ![[simple_gaussian.png]]

Gaussian fillters are used to create a scaled space, so it like seeing the image at a different scale. 
- To extract features, we try to find the scale invariant features. 

The higher $\sigma$, the stronger the smoothing caused by the filter. This can be understood, e.g., by observing that as $\sigma$ increases, the weights of closer points get smaller while those of farther points get larger.

As $\sigma$ gets larger, small details disappear and the image content deals with larger size structures. Thus, filtering with a chosen $\sigma$ can be thought of as setting the “scale” of interest to analyse image content.

The larger the kernel, the more computation we need to do. 

\[...\]

We need a rule of thumb to decide the kernel dimension of the gaussian. 

## Deploying Separability
To further speed-up the filtering operation, one can deploy the separability property: due to the _2D Gaussian_ being the product of _two 1D Gaussians_, the original _2D convolution can be split into the chain of two 1D convolutions_, i.e. either along x first and then along y, or viceversa.

$(2k + 1)^2$ 

Gaussians are still going to spread the noise, since it's still a weighted sum. So we need non-linear filters. 

## Median filters
_Non-linear filters_ whereby each pixel intensity is replaced by the median over a given neighbourhood, the median being the value falling half-way in the sorted set of intensities.

\[...\]
Median is very good with impulse noise, but it cannot deal with Gaussian noise.
So we combine the 2 filters. 

## Bilateral Filter
![[window_bilateral.png]]
![[output_bilateral.png]]

Each intensity value inside the window I'm considering dependes on both the pixel p on which I'm computing the value, and q in which I'm computing the \[...\]

We can define a kernel H which is the multiplication of those two function. 
$s$ stands for _spatial_, $r$ stands for _range_.

This gaussian is gonna be high when ...
the weight of the kernel is gonna be high, so they contribute on the fact that the contribution of the kernel is gonna be high. 

Normalization Factor (Unity Gain)
$$W(p) = \sum_{q \in s} G_{\sigma_{s}} (d_s(p,q)) G_{\sigma_{r}} (d_r(p,q))$$
It is useful to not change the overall intensity in the image. 
- If the kernel is not summed to 1, I'm gonna have [...] since the sum does not sum to 1, otherwise we are shriking or amplifying. 
- Used also in Gaussian noise.
