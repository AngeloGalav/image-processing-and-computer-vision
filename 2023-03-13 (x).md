# Edge detection
- Sharp change of a 1D signal (1D step-edge)
	- In the transition region between the two constant levels the absolute value of the first derivative gets high (and reaches an extremum at the inflection point)
	- The simplest edge-detection operator relies on thresholding the absolute value of the derivative of the signal
		- Derivatives are the best tools so far to compute edges.

The absolute value it is because if we go from high intensity to low intensity, the derivative is negative, but the edge is still there lool. 

## Edge detection
A 2D Step-Edge is characterized not only by its strength but also its direction:
![[images/edge_detection.png]]

- An operator which allow us to sense the edge whatever its direction is the _gradient_:
![[gradient_edge.png]]
- To determine how steep a difference is, we can use the _norm_ of the gradient. 
	- Gradient’s direction gives the direction along which the function exhibits its maximum variation 
- A generic directional derivative can be computed by the dot product between the gradient and the unit vector along the direction. 

## Edge Detection by Gradient Thresholding
![[edge_detection_by_gradient_thresh.png]]
The magnitude can give us the orientation of the edge. 

## Discrete approximation of the Gradient
To discretize derivate image derivatives, we can exploit the use of differences between intensities. 
We can use both backward an forward differences:
![[discrete_approximation.png]]![[central_differences.png]]
![[approximation_of_the_gradient_points.png]]

We can estimate the magnitude using different approximations:

The max-norm (which can be seen as an approximation of the infinite norm)
![[edge_discrete_approximation.png]]
- _The max-norm is both the fastest and the best method_, wrt to edge direction. 
	- more isotropic -> more chance to find edges. 
	- (?? more false positives?)

## Noise again
In real images an edge _will not look as smooth as we have seen_ (due to noise).
Taking derivatives of noisy signals is an ill posed problem…the solution is not robust wrt to input variations => __Derivatives amplify noise__ 
- And we cannot apply the max norm anymore, otherwise we'll be filled with false edges. 

To work with real images, an edge detector should therefore be robust to noise, so as to highlight the meaningful edges only and filter out effectively the spurious transitions caused by noise
- To get rid of noise, this is usually achieved by smoothing the signal before computing the derivatives required to highlight edges 
- smoothing side-effect: blurring true edges, making it more difficult to detect and localize them.

Pixel of different colors will look similar after filtering because of the blending.

- Smoothing and differentiation can be carried out jointly within a single step 
	- This is achieved by computing differences of averages (rather than averaging the image and then computing differences) 
	- To try avoiding smoothing across edges the two operations are carried out along orthogonal directions 

We can compute the differences on averages. 

![[differences_on_the_averages.png]]

![[differences_on_the_average_2.png]]
(obviously we can do this operation on the $x$ direction also).

Partial derivative can be used to compute the _magnitude_
- we can take account of the division during the threshold. 

## Prewitt and Sobel
![[prewitt_sobel.png]]
- Sobel -> more weight to central points

## Edges Detection
-  Detecting edges by gradient thresholding is inherently inaccurate: 
	- It is difficult to choose the right threshold 
	- the image contains meaningful edges characterized by different contrast (i.e. “stronger” as well as “weaker”) 
	- Trying to detect weak edges implies poor localization of stronger ones
![[edges_detection.png]]
A better approach to detect edges may consist in finding the _local maxima_ of the absolute value of the derivative of the signal.

## Non-maxima Suppresion (NMS) 
Since we don't know the threshold to use, we have to use another solution -> we need NMS in order to find a local maxima and consider only the points that are local maxima, so that we can apply a threshold (?).   
When dealing with images (2D signals) one should look for: 
- maxima of the absolute value of the derivative (i.e. the gradient magnitude).  
- along the gradient direction (i.e. orthogonal to the edge direction). 
![[nms_suppression.png]]
- Gradient is a vector. 
- The direction given by the maximum variation of the gradient. 

-  We don’t know in advance the correct direction to carry out NMS 
	- The direction has to be estimated locally (based on gradient’s direction)
 
![[nms_suppresion.png]]
- The magnitude of the gradient has to be estimated at points which do not belong to the discrete pixel grid 
- Such values can be estimated by linear interpolation of those computed at the closest points belonging to the grid

![[nms_suppression_2.png]]

![[edge_pipeline_2.png]]
We now add NMS to the pipeline.
