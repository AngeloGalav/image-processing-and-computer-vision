# Edge detection
Edges capture semantic features that are important for their semantic content. 
- _Sharp_ change of a 1D signal. 

A 2D Step-Edge is characterized not only by its strength but also its _direction_:

To sense the direction of an edge, we can use the _gradient_, and determine how steep it is by using the _norm_ of the gradient. 

## Discrete approximation of the Gradient
To _discretize derivate_ image derivatives, we can exploit the use of _differences between intensities_. 
We can use forward, backward, central differences:

At the same time, we can estimate _magnitude_ of the gradient. The best to use is the __max_norm__.

##### Noise and edges
However, there's a slight problem:
Derivates amplify noise! So we need to find a find a method that it's robust to noise!!
- An edge detection method with this property must first smooth the image in order to delete noise, but in this way, we also _blur the true edges_, making them harder to be recognized.  

We can both compute the difference and the smoothing operation in a single step. 
- We compute the _difference on averages_, on _orthogonal directions_.

## Prewitt & Sobel operators
- Prewitt -> approximate partial derivatives by _central differences_ of the mean (Prewitt operator).
	- i.e. $\micro(i, j+1) - \micro(i, j-1)$
- Sobel -> the central pixel can be _weighted more_.

## Edge detection
We could use gradient thresholding to find edges. However, it's a difficult process and it's very inaccurate. 
- A better approach consists in finding the _local maxima_. 

## Non-maxima suppression (NMS)
Detecting edges by __gradient thresholding__ is inherently inaccurate, so we need NMS. 
- ABS of the derivative. 
- gradient direction.
