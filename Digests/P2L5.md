# Successful Architectures
## ZFNET

__ZFNET__ tries to reduce the “_trial and error_” approach to network design, by introducing _powerful visualizations_ for layers other than the first one. 
They found that
- Aggressive strides
- Large filters
Are very bad! (_dead filters_ in __1__$st$ layer filters, _aliasing artifcats_ in __2__$nd$ layer activations)

So:
- $𝟕 × 𝟕$ convs, _stride 2_ in the 1st layer 
- $𝟓 × 𝟓$ convs, _stride 2_ in the 2nd layer.

Aside from this, it has the same architectures of AlexNet (5 conv layers, 3 fc layers)
