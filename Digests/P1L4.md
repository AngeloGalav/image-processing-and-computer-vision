# Local invariant feature
Several times in CV you can find tasks that deal with find corresponding points. 
This is difficult because the same point can look different in different views. 

### Panorama stitching
Your phone can do that.
It creates a large image by estimating a homography, which requires at least 4 corresponding points.

### The local invariant features paradigm
The task of finding correspondences is split into 3 steps:
1. __Detection__ of _salient points_
2. __Description__: computation of a suitable descriptor based on the pixel in the neighbourhood of the points
3. __Matching__ between decriptors

_Descriptors_ should be _invariant_ (robust) to as many transformations as possible. 

### Good Detector properties
- __Repeatability__: it should find the _same keypoints_ in different views/transformations of the scene
- __Saliency__: it must found keypoints that are surrounded by _salient patterns_ (i.e. good for discrimination).

### Good Descriptor properties
- __Distinctiveness vs. Robustness Trade-off__: the description algorithm should capture the salient information around a keypoint. 
- Compactness: the descriptor should be as compact/coincise as possible. 

Speed is extremely important for detectors, since they have to be run on the whole image. 

#### Moravec Interest point detector
The cornerness at $p$ is given by the _minimum squared difference_ between the _patch_ (e.g. 7x7) centered at $p$ and those centered at its 8 _neighbours_.

## Harris corner detector
It uses Mavec's interest point detector, and assume that we shift the image with a generic shift $(\Delta x, \Delta y)$:
- $w(x,y)$ is a __window__ _set to 1_ around the _pixel_ under evaluation and 0 _in all the image_ 
- in the end consider only the pixel around the $x,y$ position

$M$ is the __structure matrix__, and encodes the _local image structure_. 
Now, let's hypotesize $M$ as a _diagonal matrix_. 
- $\lambda_1, \lambda_2 \sim 0$, then it's flat
- $\lambda_1 >> \lambda_2$, there's an edge
- $\lambda_1, \lambda_2 \uparrow$, then it's a corner

Since $M$ is real and symmetric, it can be _diagonalized_, and be rotated into the matrix that we wanted. 
- The columns of $R$ are the __orthogonal unit eigenvectors__ of $M$ 
- $λ_i$ the corresponding _eigenvalues_. 
- $R^T$ is the _rotation matrix_ that _aligns_ the _image axes_ to the _eigenvectors_ of $M$

Since we would need to compute _eigenvalues_ at each pixel would be _costly_, 
we compute a more efficient “_cornerness_” function:
