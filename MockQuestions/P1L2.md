1. Explain the concept of temporal mean denoising. How does it use multiple images to reduce noise?
2. Describe spatial mean denoising. What is the role of the supporting window in this approach?
3. What are image filters, and how do they compute the new intensity of a pixel based on its neighborhood?
4. Define linearity and translation-equivariance in the context of image filters. How are these properties expressed mathematically?
5. What is convolution, and how is it applied to image processing? Discuss the properties associated with convolution.
6. Differentiate between convolution and correlation. Why is correlation not commutative?
7. Explain the process of discrete convolution. How is the convolution operation computed for each pixel in the output image?
8. What is mean filtering, and how does it contribute to image denoising? Discuss its advantages and limitations.
9. Describe the concept of Gaussian filtering. How does the choice of sigma affect the filtering result, and what is the rule-of-thumb for selecting the kernel size?
10. Explain the separability property of the Gaussian kernel. How does it allow for a faster filtering operation?
11. What is a median filter? How does it differ from mean filtering, and in what scenarios is it useful?
12. Discuss the bilateral filter and its role in denoising. How does it preserve edges while reducing Gaussian-like noise?
13. Describe the non-local means filter and its denoising approach based on patch similarity spread. How does it differ from other denoising methods?
