1. Describe the pinhole camera model. What components does it consist of, and how does it form an image?
2. Explain the concept of perspective projection in the pinhole camera model. How are 3D coordinates mapped onto a 2D image plane?
3. Discuss the coordinate systems involved in perspective projection, namely the image reference system (IRS) and the camera reference system (CRS). How are they related?
4. Provide the conversion formulas between the image reference system (IRS) and the camera reference system (CRS).
5. What is stereo vision, and how does it address the loss of information in mapping 3D coordinates to a 2D space? What are the assumptions and limitations of stereo vision?
6. Define the disparity in stereo vision. How is depth derived from disparity, and what is the fundamental relationship that relates them?
7. Explain the concept of stereo matching and how it helps find correspondences between points in two stereo images.
8. What is epipolar geometry, and how does it relate to stereo vision? Define the epipolar line and its significance in finding correspondences between points in stereo images.
9. Discuss the process of rectification in stereo vision. What does it involve, and how does it simplify the search for correspondences?
10. Describe the properties of perspective projections and their impact on geometric properties, such as ratios, parallelism, and lengths.
11. What is the role of lenses in overcoming the limitations of the pinhole camera model? Explain the lens formula and its variables.
12. Discuss the concept of circles of confusion and their relationship with the depth of field (DOF) in a camera.
13. Explain how the diaphragm in cameras affects the distance between the image plane and the lens. What is the purpose of adjusting this distance?
14. What is the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the context of cameras? How does it impact image quality?
