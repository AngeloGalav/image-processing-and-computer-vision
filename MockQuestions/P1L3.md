1. What is the basic intuition behind edge detection in image processing?
2. Explain the concept of a step-edge in a 2D image. How is the direction of an edge determined using the gradient?
3. How are image derivatives discretely approximated using differences between intensities? Discuss forward, backward, and central differences.
4. What is the challenge posed by noise in edge detection, and how can it be addressed? Discuss the trade-off between noise suppression and blurring of true edges.
5. Compare and contrast the Prewitt and Sobel operators for edge detection. How do they approximate partial derivatives differently?
6. Describe the process of finding edges using local maxima. Why is gradient thresholding alone considered inaccurate?
7. What is non-maxima suppression (NMS) in the context of edge detection? How does it address the limitations of gradient thresholding?
8. Explain the steps involved in the Canny edge detector. Discuss the three criteria proposed by Canny to measure the performance of an edge detector.
9. Describe the concept of hysteresis in edge detection. How does it help in detecting edges in the presence of noise?
10. What is the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) operator? How does it differ from using first-order derivatives for edge detection?
11. Explain the process of zero-crossing in the context of edge detection using the second derivative. Why does it require computational effort?
12. How is the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) used for edge detection? Describe the steps involved, including Gaussian smoothing and zero-crossing extraction.
13. What are the advantages of using the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) for edge detection? How does it allow control over smoothing and scale analysis?
